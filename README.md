# GHOFundMe 

*ETHGlobal LFGHO Hackathon project.*

Welcome to GHOFundMe! We have developed a Treasury Management Platform to bring deep insights and effective management to DAO treasury. Our platform is specifically designed for the use of GHO stablecoins for day to day operations and payments to contributors providing a stable and reliable currency for everyday transactions while allowing teams to supply their own tokens as collateral. The tool is built with [Scaffold-ETH#2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2). 

Here's what we're aiming to do:

1. Simplified and Stable Finances for DAOs: We make financial transactions within DAOs easy and stable by using GHO. This helps avoid the fluctuations in other cryptocurrencies, ensuring payments are as reliable as traditional money.
2. Enhanced Insights: Our platform gives the core team of a DAO a clear, insightful overview of their finances. This means better decision-making and a clearer understanding of the treasury's status.
3. Broader Use and Understanding of Stablecoins: We aim to increase the adoption and awareness of stablecoins like GHO in everyday scenarios.
