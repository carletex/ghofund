# GHOFund 

*ETHGlobal LFGHO Hackathon project.*

Welcome to GHOFund! We have developed a Treasury Management Platform to bring deep insights and effective management to DAO treasury.

## Features

- **Reliable Income for Contributors**: By utilizing GHO for compensation, we promote financial stability for members.
- **Comprehensive Treasury Overview & direct integration with DeFi**:The platform provides a clear view of a DAO's finances, including collateral status, GHO balance, and overall financial health. You can effectively manage and view all your finances on a single dashboard.
